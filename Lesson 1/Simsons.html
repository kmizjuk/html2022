    Lisa Marie Simpson (born May 9)[9] is the elder daughter and middle child of the Simpson family and one of the two
    tritagonists (along with Marge,) of The Simpsons series.Lisa lacks parental involvement of Homer and Marge, which
    leads to hobbies such as playing saxophone and guitar, riding and caring for horses, and interest in advanced
    studies. In school, Lisa's popularity is affected by those who view her as a geeky overachiever, which leaves her
    with only a few friends.

<h3>Lisa says:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>“BAAAAART!!”</li>
    <li>“If anyone wants me, I'll be in my room.”</li>
    <li>“Homer.”</li>
